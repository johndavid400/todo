# 3. Use Express and Typescript

Date: 2024-02-27

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Needed to pick a language and framework to build the Todo application. It should be written in a language that is easy to work on by developers and a framework that is well-documented.

## Decision

We decided that Javascript/Typescript was a popular language that would be easy for developers to work on and the Express web framework is also popular and well-documented.

## Consequences

There may be a better framework to use that is more easily adoptable.
